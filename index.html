    <p class="lead">The US company behind a proposed Las Vegas-style "Sphere" venue in east London has withdrawn its plans.</p>

    <p>Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSG) said it could not participate in a process that was "merely a political football between rival parties".</p>

    <p>In December, Housing Secretary Michael Gove used his powers to review the rejection of planning permission by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.</p>

    <p>MSG had wanted to build its 21,000-capacity Sphere venue in Stratford.</p>

    <p>In a letter to the Planning Inspectorate, MSG said it was "extremely disappointing" that Londoners would "not benefit from the Sphere's groundbreaking technology and the thousands of well-paying jobs it would have created".</p>

    <p>The letter said: "I write to confirm that we are officially withdrawing our application from the Planning Inspectorate process.</p>

    <p>"After spending millions of pounds acquiring our site in Stratford and collaboratively engaging in a five-year planning process with numerous governmental bodies, including the local planning authority who approved our plans following careful review, we cannot continue to participate in a process that is merely a political football between rival parties."</p>
